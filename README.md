### Hi
My name is Oliwier. I'm from Poland and I'm 14 years old. I began learning when I was 10. I like playing drums and piano.
## Story of learning
When I saw what could you do with html and css, I started learning from polish YouTube channel pasja informatyki. Then I learned SQL and PHP. My biggest problem was JS. So I stopped with web development and started learning python. At age 14 I learned java for minecraft forge mod development.
## I'm working on
 - Minecraft modpack similar to Sev: Tech ages and create: above and beyond
