### Hi! 👋
My name is Oliwier. I'm from Poland 🇵🇱 and I'm 14 years old. I began learning when I was 10. I like playing drums 🥁 and piano 🎹.

## Story of learning 📚
When I saw what could you do with html and css, I started learning from polish YouTube channel pasja informatyki. Then I learned SQL and PHP. My biggest problem was JS. So I stopped with web development and started learning python 🐍. At age 14 I learned java ☕ for minecraft forge mod development.

## I'm working on 🛠️
- Minecraft modpack similar to SevTech Ages and Create: Above and Beyond
